# Scaphoid-project
This project creates a segmentation tool for the scaphoid bone and a fracture in it.
The user can later adjust the results using a free 3D visualization tool (such as ITK-SNAP), and then run an analysis on the segmentation.

All of the documentation are in the code, as well as an attached PDF to that explains how to run the code as well as explenation on the functions.
